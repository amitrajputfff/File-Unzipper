# File Unzipper with Huffman Encoding/Decoding and GUI in Java

## Overview

This project is a Java-based file unzipper with a graphical user interface (GUI) and Huffman encoding/decoding functionality. It allows users to select a compressed file, unzip it using Huffman decoding, and save the decoded text to another file. The project utilizes Swing for creating the GUI components and provides a simple yet effective solution to unzip files encoded with Huffman encoding.

## Features

- Graphical user interface for selecting a compressed file and unzipping it.
- Huffman encoding and decoding functionality.
